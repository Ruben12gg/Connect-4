# Connect-4
This was made for a project for the subject of Algorithms from the DTAM CTESP course of ESMAD.
The Project goal was to recreate a popular board game and give it a twist, add one rule created by us. In this one, we recreated Connect 4 and added a random 3rd color player that would automatically place a piece on the board after every 3 plays from the players.
It was made by me and a friend. It uses Javascript for game logic, HTML and CSS for styling.
